# Amateur radio

Calling everyone interested in radio technology! North Hackerspace is _the_ place in Madrid to experiment with radios, digital modes, and more.

## Nifty stuff
- Satellites from which to download images, while live in orbit.
- Repeaters, close and far away, to expand your communications reach.
- Waves bouncing off the Moon's surface, the ionosphere, or meteors.
- Wireless technology testing and hacking.
- Communication protocols creation, RF bands to experiment in, and playing telecom company without the paperwork hassle.

## Why? I can message people through my phone.
Because it is cool that with a simple antenna, the air around you turns into an information exchange medium, full of opportunities to explore. Why not?

## The license
Transmitting requires an operator's license - and as such, you'll ahve to study electronics, physics, and Spanish regulations for an exam. It is worth it, and not that hard - perhaps we can help you in your studies?

Ask us anytime if you are interested in obtaining the license.
